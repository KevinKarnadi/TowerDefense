## About

A 2D Tower Defense Game that I created for the assignment of my Introduction to Programming II class (Spring 2021).

## Description

This game is written in C++, and uses the Allegro5 library.

### Gameplay

In this game, you need to defend your house from the incoming invaders.

There are various kinds characters that you can place on the map, each with different appearances and characteristics:

On every round, you need to prevent the enemies from entering your house (your house is on the left side of the map). The game will end if there is no enemy left or if there is at least one enemy that crosses the left side of the map.

### Controls

Click on a character to select it and click on an empty tile to place it
